I designed and developed a fully responsive personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and background as a developer. The site was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on clean design, performance optimization, and user experience.

Key accomplishments and features include:

🔹 Custom Design: Created a modern, minimal layout that reflects my personal brand and emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and usability.

🔹 Responsive Layout: Implemented responsive design principles using CSS Flexbox and media queries to ensure a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

🔹 Smooth Navigation: Developed intuitive navigation with anchor links and animated scroll behavior to improve user interaction and flow.

🔹 Performance Optimizations: Minimized load times by optimizing images, reducing render-blocking resources, and using semantic HTML.

🔹 Project Showcase: Highlighted my major projects with engaging visuals, concise descriptions, and direct links to live demos and GitHub repositories.

🔹 Deployment: Deployed the site using Vercel, allowing for continuous updates and fast global delivery.

This project not only reflects my front-end development abilities but also serves as an evolving platform to demonstrate future work and growth in web technologies.
